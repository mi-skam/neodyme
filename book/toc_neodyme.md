## **Why This Structure Works for neodyme**

1. **Real Problems**: Each chapter solves actual backend development challenges
2. **Progressive Complexity**: From single endpoint to production system
3. **Practical Focus**: Uses actual neodyme code, not toy examples
4. **Modern Stack**: FastAPI, SQLModel, async patterns - what professionals use
5. **Production Ready**: Ends with deployable, scalable system
6. **Teaching Progression**: Concepts build naturally without overwhelming

This structure takes developers from "I can make an API" to "I can build production backends" using neodyme as the practical vehicle for learning.
