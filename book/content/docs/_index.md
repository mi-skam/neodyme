# Building Neodyme: A Modern Python Backend Journey

*Problem-Solution + Progressive Complexity Structure*

## Book Overview
This book teaches modern Python backend development by building "Neodyme" - a production-ready FastAPI application. Each chapter solves real problems developers face, building complexity progressively while maintaining practical focus.

## Target Audience
Intermediate Python developers who want to build professional backends using modern tools and patterns.

## **Part I: Foundation Problems (Core Backend Basics)**

### Chapter 1: "I Need a Web API That Actually Works"
**Problem**: Creating a reliable HTTP API that handles requests properly
- **Pain Point**: Basic Flask/Django tutorials don't teach production patterns
- **Theory**: HTTP fundamentals, ASGI vs WSGI, automatic documentation
- **Simple Solution**: Single FastAPI endpoint with proper response models
- **What You Learn**: FastAPI basics, app structure, automatic documentation

### Chapter 2: "I Need to Store Data That Persists"
**Problem**: Moving beyond in-memory storage to real databases
- **Pain Point**: Raw SQL is tedious, ORMs are confusing, async is hard
- **Theory**: ORM patterns, async database operations, SQLModel benefits
- **Simple Solution**: Single User model with basic CRUD
- **What You Learn**: SQLModel basics, database connections, async patterns

### Chapter 3: "I Need to Validate Data Without Going Crazy"
**Problem**: Ensuring data integrity without writing endless validation code
- **Pain Point**: Manual validation is error-prone and repetitive
- **Theory**: Schema validation, serialization, type safety
- **Simple Solution**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **What You Learn**: Pydantic integration, request/response models, automatic validation

### Chapter 4: "I Need My Database to Evolve Over Time"
**Problem**: Managing database schema changes without losing data
- **Pain Point**: Manual schema changes break in production
- **Theory**: Database migrations, version control for schemas
- **Simple Solution**: Alembic integration with SQLModel
- **What You Learn**: Migration patterns, Alembic workflow, schema evolution

## **Part II: Integration Problems (System Design)**

### Chapter 5: "I Need Clean Architecture That Scales"
**Problem**: Organizing code so it doesn't become a mess
- **Pain Point**: Everything in one file doesn't work long-term
- **Theory**: Repository pattern, dependency injection, layered architecture
- **What You Learn**: Repository pattern, clean architecture, dependency management

### Chapter 6: "I Need to Handle Errors Like a Professional"
**Problem**: Graceful error handling and debugging
- **Pain Point**: Cryptic 500 errors and poor error messages
- **Theory**: Exception hierarchies, structured logging, error standardization
- **What You Learn**: Exception design, error middleware, debugging strategies

### Chapter 7: "I Need Security That Actually Protects"
**Problem**: Authentication and authorization without security holes
- **Pain Point**: Rolling your own auth is dangerous
- **Theory**: Password hashing, JWT tokens, security best practices
- **What You Learn**: Security fundamentals, hashing, token management

### Chapter 8: "I Need Configuration That Works Everywhere"
**Problem**: Managing settings across development, testing, and production
- **Pain Point**: Hard-coded values break deployments
- **Theory**: 12-factor configuration, environment management
- **What You Learn**: Configuration patterns, environment management, deployment prep

## **Part III: Real-World Problems (Production Concerns)**

### Chapter 9: "I Need Tests That Give Me Confidence"
**Problem**: Testing async code and database operations
- **Pain Point**: Testing databases and HTTP endpoints is complex
- **Theory**: Test strategies, fixtures, mocking, async testing
- **What You Learn**: pytest patterns, async testing, test databases

### Chapter 10: "I Need Deployment That Actually Works"
**Problem**: Getting from laptop to production
- **Pain Point**: "Works on my machine" syndrome
- **Theory**: Containerization, process management, health checks
- **What You Learn**: Docker patterns, deployment strategies, production configuration

### Chapter 11: "I Need to Monitor and Debug Production"
**Problem**: Understanding what's happening in production
- **Pain Point**: Black box deployments are impossible to debug
- **Theory**: Observability, logging, metrics, health monitoring
- **What You Learn**: Production monitoring, debugging strategies, performance optimization

### Chapter 12: "I Need to Scale Beyond One Machine"
**Problem**: Handling growth and performance requirements
- **Pain Point**: Simple solutions don't scale
- **Theory**: Caching, database optimization, async patterns, load balancing
- **What You Learn**: Scaling strategies, performance optimization, production architecture
